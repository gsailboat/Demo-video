# Demo-video
Video highlighting my last four projects as a "thank you" for people wishing me happy birthday on Facebook.

This video demostrates the C programs associated with Fractol, Wolf3d and RTV1. RapidPoll is a JS site that was made with Rapid.io's database to make a realtime survey experience. If you want to know more about the individual projects, you can access them from my Git.
